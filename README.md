# Raspberry Pi based Weather Station

This project presents the design and implementation of a weather station built around a
Raspberry Pi, a versatile single-board computer. The Raspberry Pi, coupled with a variety
of sensors, allows for the collection of real-time weather data. The collected data is then
processed and displayed on a webpage for analysis and visualization.
